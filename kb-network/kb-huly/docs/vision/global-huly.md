    A[Traditional Isolation] -->|Evolution| B[Global Huly]
    B --> C[Universal Identity]
    B --> D[Fluid Workspaces]
    B --> E[Seamless Collaboration]
    C --> F[Permanent Identities]
    D --> G[Dynamic Containers]
    E --> H[Cross-Org Flow]
    F --> I[Blockchain Auth]
    G --> J[Resource Sharing]
    H --> K[Natural Patterns]
```

## Current Limitations

### Organizational Silos
- Isolated workspaces
- Limited external collaboration
- Redundant tooling
- Communication barriers

### Traditional Architecture
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Security through separation
- Limited cross-org features
- Complex integration needs

- Real-time cooperation
- Resource optimization
- Knowledge sharing

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Universal identity system
2. Cross-workspace access
3. Shared resource pools
4. Initial integration framework

### Phase 2: Enhancement
1. Advanced permissions
2. Resource optimization
3. Collaboration tools
4. Analytics and insights

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. AI-powered matching
2. Automated workflows
3. Smart resource allocation
4. Performance optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Identity Management
