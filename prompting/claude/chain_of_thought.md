# Chain of Thought Prompting with Claude

Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting is a powerful technique that improves Claude's performance on complex tasks by encouraging step-by-step reasoning. This guide covers implementation using our prompt generator system.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic CoT prompt
/prompt solve problem \
  --template chain_of_thought \
  --req "Show reasoning" \
  --req "Include verification"

# Advanced CoT with branching
/prompt analyze problem \
  --template cot_advanced \
  --var PATHS="approach1,approach2" \
  --req "Compare approaches" \
  --req "Justify selection"
```

## When to Use Chain of Thought

### Ideal Use Cases
1. Complex problem-solving tasks
2. Multi-step reasoning
3. Mathematical calculations
4. Logical analysis
5. Decision-making processes
6. Code analysis and debugging
7. Research and investigation

### When Not to Use
1. Simple factual queries
2. Basic text generation
3. Direct classification tasks
4. When immediate responses are required (CoT adds some latency)

## Implementation with Prompt Generator

### 1. Basic Chain of Thought
```bash
# Template selection
/prompt solve problem \
  --template chain_of_thought \
  --steps "understand,analyze,solve,verify"

# Generated template
<task>
[Problem description]
</task>

<thinking_process>
1. Understanding Phase
   - What are we solving?
   - What information do we have?
   - What are our goals?

2. Analysis Phase
   - Break down components
   - Identify relationships
   - Note constraints

3. Solution Phase
   - Develop approach
   - Apply method
   - Document steps

4. Verification Phase
   - Check results
   - Test edge cases
   - Validate solution
</thinking_process>
```

### 2. Interactive Chain of Thought
```bash
# Interactive problem solving
/prompt --interactive solve \
  --template cot_interactive \
  --var MODE="detailed"

# Generated session
<session>
1. Problem Definition
   [System prompts for problem details]

2. Approach Selection
   [System offers solution strategies]

3. Step-by-Step Solution
   [System guides through each step]

4. Verification Process
   [System helps verify solution]
</session>
```

### 3. Self-Questioning Framework
```bash
# Generate self-questioning template
/prompt analyze problem \
  --template cot_questions \
  --var DEPTH="detailed" \
  --req "Include reasoning"

# Generated framework
<analysis_framework>
1. Initial Questions
   - What is the core problem?
   - What are our constraints?
   - What does success look like?

2. Deep Analysis
   - How do components interact?
   - What are potential issues?
   - Where are the edge cases?

3. Solution Development
   - What approaches are possible?
   - Which is most suitable?
   - How can we verify?

4. Validation Questions
   - Have we met all requirements?
   - What could go wrong?
   - How can we improve?
</analysis_framework>
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 2. Recursive Analysis
```bash
# Generate recursive analysis
/prompt analyze deep \
  --template cot_recursive \
  --var DEPTH="3" \
  --req "Show all levels"

# Generated framework
<recursive_analysis>
1. Initial Analysis
   - Base assumptions
   - First conclusions
   - Identified gaps

2. Level 1 Recursion
   - Question assumptions
   - Find counter-arguments
   - Refine thinking

3. Level 2 Recursion
   - Challenge refinements
   - Explore edge cases
   - Strengthen logic

4. Level 3 Recursion

   - Documentation
</recursive_analysis>
```

### 3. Quality Assurance
```bash
# Validate CoT process
/prompt verify reasoning \
  --template cot_qa \
  --checks "logic,completeness,clarity"

# Monitor effectiveness
/prompt analyze results \
  --template cot_metrics \
  --var METRICS="accuracy,coverage,depth"
```

### 3. Expert Role CoT
```xml
<system>
You are a senior software architect with 20 years of experience. Think through this design problem as you would in a real architecture review.
</system>

<thought_process>
1. First, consider the business requirements
2. Then, evaluate technical constraints
3. Next, analyze scalability implications
4. Finally, assess maintenance considerations

Explain your expert reasoning at each step.
</thought_process>
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Structure and Clarity
- Break down complex problems into clear steps
- Use numbered lists or bullet points
- Include transition phrases between steps
- Maintain logical flow

### 2. Depth vs. Breadth
- Balance detailed analysis with practical constraints
- Focus on most relevant aspects
- Avoid unnecessary tangents
- Maintain appropriate depth for task complexity

### 3. Validation and Verification
- Verify intermediate conclusions
- Cross-check reasoning steps
- Consider edge cases
- Validate final results
