# Claude Prompt Engineering Best Practices

This guide summarizes key best practices for engineering effective prompts for Claude, based on Anthropic's official documentation.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Clarity and Directness
- Be specific and detailed in prompts
- Provide all necessary context upfront
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Structure information logically

### 2. Examples and Multishot Prompting
- Include well-crafted examples to guide behavior
- Structure examples to match desired output
- Use few-shot prompting for consistency
- Provide diverse examples for generalization

### 3. Chain of Thought
- Allow step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks
- Break down problems into smaller components
- Give space for analytical thinking
- Include intermediate steps in reasoning

### 4. Structured Formatting
- Use XML tags to organize content
- Create clear sections for different components
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Label different types of information

### 5. Role Definition
- Use system prompts to set clear roles
- Define expertise and constraints
- Maintain consistent role throughout
- Include relevant context for the role

### 6. Output Control
- Specify desired output format clearly
- Prefill response templates when needed
- Include validation criteria
- Structure response sections

### 7. Complex Task Management
- Chain prompts for multi-stage tasks
- Break down complex problems
- Include error handling
- Validate intermediate steps

## Implementation Guidelines

### Setting Up Prompts
1. Define clear success criteria
2. Establish evaluation metrics
3. Create initial prompt draft
4. Test and iterate based on results

### Optimization Tips
1. Choose appropriate model for task
2. Optimize prompt and output length
3. Use streaming for better latency
4. Implement caching when beneficial

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Vague or ambiguous instructions
2. Insufficient context
3. Inconsistent formatting
4. Lack of error handling
5. Overly complex single prompts

## Best Practices by Task Type

### Analysis Tasks
- Include specific analysis criteria
- Break down into clear steps
- Request structured output
- Include validation steps

### Generation Tasks
- Provide clear constraints
- Include style guidelines
- Specify output format
- Use examples for tone/style

### Interaction Tasks
- Define conversation flow
- Include error handling
- Specify response formats
- Maintain consistent role

## Evaluation and Iteration

### Testing Prompts
1. Use diverse test cases
2. Validate against criteria
3. Check edge cases
4. Measure performance

### Iterative Improvement
1. Gather performance data
2. Identify failure points
3. Refine prompt structure
4. Test improvements
